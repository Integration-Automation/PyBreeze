# progress.md: PyBreeze

Outstanding work only. When an item is done, delete it in the same commit and add a `#done` entry to `docs/updates/` (format and query commands: `docs/updates/README.md`). No finished items, no history, no rules (rules live in `CLAUDE.md`).
Item numbers (`#n`) are never reused. Tags: [DECIDE] needs the owner's decision, [BLOCKED] waits on something else, [UNVERIFIED] observed but not confirmed.
Cross-repo and workspace items live in `D:\Codes\progress.md` (relevant here: X-1, X-13, X-17).

## Open

- **#2** [DECIDE] Closing one run window leaves its child running, with no window and no way to stop it short of a task manager; only closing the whole IDE stops it (`PyBreezeMainWindow.closeEvent`, `pybreeze/pybreeze_ui/editor_main/main_ui.py`). Should closing a run window stop its run (`CodeWindow.stop_runner()` exists; `CodeWindow.closeEvent` today only lets the main window forget a finished one), ask first, or keep going on purpose (for example a long load test that mails its report)?
- **#26** A plugin run that compiles first runs the compiler on the UI thread (`pybreeze/extend/process_executor/file_runner_process.py` `_compile_and_run`, `subprocess.run(..., timeout=60)`): the IDE is frozen for the whole compile, up to 60 s, and the compiler's output only appears once it has finished. The compile should go through the same streamed process path as the run, with the run started when the compile exits 0.
